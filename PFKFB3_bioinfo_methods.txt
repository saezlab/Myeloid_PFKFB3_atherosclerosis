2.1 Single-cell gene expression analysis
Three single-cell RNA-seq datasets from atherosclerotic plaques were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database or requested to corresponding authors:  Wirka et al 2019 (4 human specimens, GSE131780) [ref+1], Zernecke et al 2020 (meta-analysis from 9 mice datasets) [ref+2], and van Kuijk et al (11 pooled Ldlr-/-LysMCre+/- mice, GSE150089). Seurat R package (v. 3.0.1) was used as a toolbox for the analysis [ref+3] in R (version 3.6.1). Single-cell gene expression was normalized by the library size, multiplied by a scaling factor of 10,000 and log-transformed. The annotation of cell clusters from the original studies was used for the analysis. HIF1A/Hif1a transcription factor (TF) activity was estimated using DoRothEA (https://saezlab.github.io/dorothea/) [ref+4], using the transcription factor regulons of A, B, and C confidence classes as previously described for single-cell transcriptomics [ref+5]. For 2-group comparison between cells undergoing and not undergoing hypoxia response, cells were stratified by the third quartile (Q3) of HIF1A/Hif1a TF activity within each cell cluster (high > Q3, and Low ≤ Q3). Differential PFKFB3/Pfkfb3 expression was performed using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. No test was done when the sample size of any condition was lower than 5 observations. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini & Hochberg method. R effect sizes from Wilcoxon Rank Sum test were calculated as Z divided by the square root of total observations. The greater the absolute r value is, the greater the effect size is, with positive values for an effect in cells with High HIF1A/Hif1a activity. Dot plots show the percentage of cells within the cell cluster that express the gene (size), and the average expression of each cluster scaled across clusters. Violin plots show the normalized gene expression level of each cell cluster with individual observations (each cell) as data points, and sample sizes (number of cells) at the bottom. For 2-group comparisons, violin plots are split by hypoxia response stratification, with Wilcoxon test statistics of FDR-adjusted p-values and r effect sizes at the top. Code for the analysis is available at https://github.com/saezlab/Myeloid_PFKFB3_atherosclerosis .
