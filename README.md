## Objective:
PFKFB3 enzyme activity, a key regulator of glycolytic flux, has been associated to atherogenesis. 
Previous studies has been shown that systemic inhibition of its activity reduce atherosclerotic plaques. 
It is unclear which cells of the system are involved in such event. Myeloid cells are key players in
atherosclerotic plaques. In our study, we investigate the role of Macrophage and Neutrophils in 
PFKFB3 partial inhibition and its effects in atherosclerotic plaque formation. For this, we use
public datasets of single-cell RNA-sq atherosclerotic plaques in human and mouse to explore which
plaque cells express PFKFB3 and its isoforms.
