## Objective:
Atherosclerotic plaque hypoxia is detrimental for macrophage function in the plaque. 
Prolyl hydroxylases (PHD) initiate cellular responses to hypoxia and may therefore govern 
macrophage function in plaque hypoxia. PHD inhibitors are clinically investigated to treat 
anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, but the consequences for cardiovascular 
disease are not clear. Hence, we studied the influence of myeloid specific PHD deficiency 
on atherosclerotic plaque development and stability.

## Data
Two major tiers of data were generated to uncover the role of Myeloid PHD2 in atherogenesis 
for the bioinformatics analysis described here.

1. In-vitro experiments with cell lines were profiled using conventional RNA-seq sequencing. 
Empirical observations suggested that the impact of PHD2 knock-out in Macrophages triggers 
self-controlled apoptosis but not collagen enhancement for atherogenesis. Thus, BMDM (macrophages) 
carrying PHD2cKO and PHD2-WT were compared to uncover potential inddirect impact of the gene 
perturbation in the myeloid cells in atherogenesis. This assay was followed by a second one that 
aimed to characterize mesenchymal cells that potentially could promote fibrosis (smooth muscle cells
and fibroblasts). These cells were subjected of conditioned medium cultured by the BMDM with and 
without the functional knock-out of PHD2 to investigate its influence in pro-collagen producing cells 
in atherosclerotic plaques. Only 3T3 cells (fibroblast cell line) showed an increase in collagen 
production/secretion. Therefore, 3T3 cells stimulated with conditioned medium culture derived from 
BMDM cells with and without PHD2-KO were profiled for further investigation.

2. In-vivo experiments with a generated model carrying KO and WT forms of PHD2 in the myeloid 
lineage (incl. macrophages) were subjected of a high cholesterol diet to promote atherosclerosis. 
Atherosclerotic plaques (pool n=8 per condition) from this model were subjected of single-cell RNA
sequencing.
